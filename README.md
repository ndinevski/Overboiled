## Overview
**Overboiled** is a fast-paced, addictive “bubble-popping” game where you must prevent a boiling liquid from spilling over by popping bubbles. The longer you last without letting the milk (or other liquids) overflow, the higher your score climbs. Make strategic decisions to maximize combos, collect gold, and rise to the top of the leaderboards.

## Gameplay
1. **Boiling Liquid**  
   You start with a container of milk on a stove. As time progresses, the liquid heats up, causing more bubbles to form faster.

2. **Bubbles**  
   Bubbles rise to the surface. Tap to pop them before they stack too high.

3. **Losing Condition**  
   If too many bubbles form on the surface, one can spill out of the container and cause the milk to **Overboil**, ending the game.

4. **Color Matching**  
   Bubbles come in different colors. Once they reach the surface, you **cannot** pop them with your finger. However, if **3 or more** bubbles of the same color connect at the surface, they pop automatically—earning you **combo multiplier** points and extra gold.

5. **Score & Leaderboards**  
   Each popped bubble increases your score. Chain pops and combos to achieve the highest score and climb the global leaderboard.

6. **Power-Ups**  
   - **Cool-Off**  
     *Effect*: Decreases the stove’s heat level, slowing bubble spawn rates.  
     *Tip*: Use it in panic moments when the bubble spawn rate is just too high.

   - **Pop All**  
     *Effect*: Instantly pops **all bubbles** of a random color anywhere in the container.  
     *Tip*: Great for quickly clearing trouble colors or building a quick score boost.

   - **Lid**  
     *Effect*: Covers the container for **5 seconds**, preventing any overflow.  
     *Tip*: Use it when the surface is dangerously crowded to buy time and pop more bubbles below.

1. **Start the Game**: Tap **Play** to begin. The stove starts at a moderate temperature.  
2. **Pop Bubbles**:
   - **Tap** directly on rising bubbles to pop them before they reach the surface.
   - **Strategize** when letting bubbles of the same color reach the surface to trigger an auto-pop and score **combo multipliers**.
3. **Watch the Heat**: The temperature (and difficulty) increases over time—stay focused, or you’ll be overwhelmed by bubbles.  
4. **Avoid Overboiling**: Don’t let too many bubbles build up on the surface. One slip and the liquid will spill over!
